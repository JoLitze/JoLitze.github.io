Duke University Innovation Co-Lab									    Durham, NC
Program Manager of 3D printing & Design Teams						      June 2022 – June 2023
・Directed the program development during merger of 3D printing, CAD, and prototyping services 
- I led the program development using my expertise in the 3D printing service and DesignHub prototyping team and pattern 
     recognition from previous client and staff handling experiences to optimize how clients were received and how design engineers 
     organized their work.
・Managed procurement and maintenance of the lab’s high-end 3D printing machines totaling $1 million in assets
・Restructured the service model and built out the finance model for the creation of a cost center
・I mentored the student staff by training them on the different 3d printing equipment and bringing them to client meetings to 
     learn the relevant information and problem solving.
・I created lab safety protocols and training guides over 3D slicing software and 3D printers, then managed training and hiring 
Technical Operator for Bluesmith 3D-Printing					   February 2021 – November 2021
・Operated and consulted for SLA, Polyjet, SLS, and FDM additive manufacturing projects in lab and medical applications.
・I used systems thinking to understand how the machines interfaced with sliced files and how the mechanisms worked.
・I learned how to optimize print quality and troubleshoot mechanical issues on SLA, Polyjet/Multi-jet, SLS printers.
・Consulted with clients on slicing preparations, printing method choices, and material compatibility for final applications
Project Manager & Design Engineer							              August 2020 – May 2022
・Handled 20+ projects and meetings with design engineers and clients from initial napkin sketch to product delivery 
・I used domain knowledge of mechanical design and deductive reasoning to apply manufacturing knowledge to unique design 
     requests from hospital and lab settings.
・I learned how to run projects efficiently, the balance of portfolios, and client partnership skills.
・I mentored the design engineers by guiding them through prototyping challenges and building BOMs.
・Improved patient, researcher, and team experiences by designing and mesh modeling then manufacturing products for clients
