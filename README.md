## Key Leadership Decision Moments
Complex Decision Making: When I began in my role as a Program Manager in the Innovation Co-Lab, I probed where staff services was not fulfilling the program mission, sensed disconnect between public offerings and the skillset of staff, and established new scheduling and client connection opportunities for university-wide accessibility. 2022
Chaotic Decision Making: During my Project Edge directorship, I pivoted an in-person, week-long program to a 3-day virtual event plan, sensed feedback from hired staffing teams, and responded with improved structures for program execution. 2020
Complicated Decision Making: In my Space Settlement Design Competition Vice presidency, I sensed relevant RFP points for key impact, analyzed progress of teams, and responded by bringing teams together on key decisions and preparing for appropriate design pitches. 2017

- Restructured the service model and built out the finance model for the creation of a cost center
- I mentored the student staff by training them on the different 3d printing equipment and bringing them to client meetings to 
     learn the relevant information and problem solving.
- I created lab safety protocols and training guides over 3D slicing software and 3D printers, then managed training and hiring 

Technical Operator for Bluesmith 3D-Printing					   February 2021 – November 2021
- Operated and consulted for SLA, Polyjet, SLS, and FDM additive manufacturing projects in lab and medical applications.
- I used systems thinking to understand how the machines interfaced with sliced files and how the mechanisms worked.
- I learned how to optimize print quality and troubleshoot mechanical issues on SLA, Polyjet/Multi-jet, SLS printers.
- Consulted with clients on slicing preparations, printing method choices, and material compatibility for final applications
